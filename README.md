# Multilingual Professional Directory for Dearborn

## Project Overview

### Core Idea
This project is a web-based platform aimed at connecting residents of Dearborn with professionals who speak multiple languages, including English, Arabic, and Spanish. The platform addresses language barriers in accessing essential services like legal aid, plumbing, and mechanics. Both professionals and users can contribute to the directory, creating a dynamic resource for the community.

## Features and Functionality

### Literature Review / Competitive Analysis

#### Competitive Landscape
The platformâ€™s main competitors are Facebook and WhatsApp community groups. Our website distinguishes itself by providing wider access, especially for those who may not be on social media, such as older adults or newcomers to Dearborn. The platform will also feature a community events page and a business listings directory, both of which accept user contributions upon admin approval.

### Unique Value Proposition
The website enables users to locate professionals based on language and profession, removing the need to rely on word-of-mouth or assumptions. For instance, a user can find a lawyer who speaks Arabic or a plumber who speaks Spanish directly on the platform.

## Implementation Plan

### Modules / Entities

#### Professional Profiles
Professionals can log in to create profiles that include:
- Name
- Profile picture
- Languages spoken
- Area of expertise
- Years of experience
- Contact details (phone number, email, business address)

#### User Contributions
Users can submit listings for professionals in the area. These contributions will require admin approval after verification.

#### Directory Navigation
A language and profession-based navigation system (e.g., drop-down menu or buttons) allows users to easily find professionals who meet their needs.
